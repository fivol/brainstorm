# Project Rules

## Git Commit Policy
- **Make a commit after every change**: After implementing any feature, fix, or modification, create a git commit with a descriptive message.
- Commit messages should be clear and describe what was changed.
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:").

## Code Style
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns.
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Keep components focused and maintainable.

## General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable code.
- Add comments for complex logic.
- Ensure code passes linting checks before committing.

## When using Worktrees feature
- add "model.txt" file with ML model specified (thinking or not also)
- Title web page with model name it created (like in model.txt)
